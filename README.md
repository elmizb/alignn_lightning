# alignn_lightning
ALIGNN gnn model with pytorch_lightning. it's totally based on https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn

This repository contains a simplified version of the `alignn` project from another repository. The code in this repo is written using `pymatgen`, `pytorch_geometric`, and `pytorch_lightning`.

## Code Description

The code in this repo is a simplified version of the `alignn` project. Although it aims to achieve the same functionality as the original code, it is simpler and more streamlined. 

However, it is important to note that the implementation of the `alignn` layer with `pytorch_geometric` has failed. Therefore, if you wish to obtain results that are similar to those of the original paper, it is recommended that you use the DGL version of the code, which is also available in this repository.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and install the required packages. Then, you can run the scripts and modify them as needed to suit your specific use case.

## Acknowledgments

This repository is based on the `alignn` project from another repository. We would like to acknowledge the authors of the original project for their work and contributions.
